# jekyll-arabic

I read online that some people want Jekyll with RTL support. So I decided to alter the basic Jekyll theme style and changed most things with Arabic texts, but it can still apply to other languages like Persian and Hebrew.

**Installation:**

Clone the repository
```
got clone https://github.com/tehchieftain/jekyll-arabic.git
```

Go to the folder
```
cd jekyll-arabic
```


Change the '_config.yml' to suit your needs
And serve it

```
Jekyll serve
```
